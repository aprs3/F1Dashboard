    "# Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this project was to investigate and possibly improve some of the existing visualisation techniques used in F1. The raw data was retrieved using the FastF1 Python package, although the data was not always accurate, this was sufficient for this project which is more focused on visualisation than accuracy. Pandas dataframes, which are compatible with FastF1 formats, were used to manage the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly was used for the visualisation, in particular plotly.graph_objects, which offers a fair amount of customisation that plotly express would not, as it is suitable for very standard plots with a few lines of code. The mindset for creating the plots took into account the concept explained during the course and the end users who will be using them (ordinary people interested in the sport, engineers, drivers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Dash was used to build an interactive app with all the plots, using the data from the API in real time. Unfortunately, this has the disadvantage that the application becomes very slow after some use because the API has a timeout after a certain number of requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this report easy to read, I will describe each plot, show the shape of the data behind it, and finally show the plot with the selected data."

    "The colour was adjusted from white for the least present nations to blue for the nation that hosted more races. Hovering over each nation shows the exact number of races and the name of the nation.\n",

The x-axis shows all the corner numbers of the track, while the y-axis shows the speed difference (positive or negative) between the reference driver and a second driver. The important channels in this graph are the green colour when the driver is gaining on the opponent and red when he is losing, and the length of the bars. The idea behind this graph is that a driver comes back into the box and has a few seconds to work out where he can improve before he goes out again. Or his engineers, who has to pass on this information. The annotation of the speed difference value within the bar makes it faster to read, and the legend makes it clear who the reference driver is.\n",

    "\n",
    "This graph shows the lap times and the compound types for the data of one driver's session. On the x-axis is the lap number and on the y-axis is the lap time. Another important channel of information is the colour of the points that represent the type of compound, as explained in the legend. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the dots gives additional information about tyre degradation and fuel consumption. If the lap times are getting slower every lap, a diagonal upward pattern (as in the example I have chosen) means that there is more tyre degradation than fuel consumption gains, making the car lighter every lap.\n",
    "On the other hand, if we have a downward diagonal pattern, it means that the car is getting lighter each lap for the fuel consumption and the tyres are not degrading much.\n",

    "* Compound strategy \n",
    "* Number of pit stops\n",
    "* Finish position of the race \n",

The same procedure is used for the number of pit stops. The colour lines have been adjusted to show the first position as red and the last positions as white. \n",
